# Admin Mode Fix & Contest Timing Features

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Mode Showing for Regular Users ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Admin test mode was showing for regular users (kjlethin24@gmail.com) because the `adminAuthenticated` flag persisted in localStorage even after logging out from admin panel.

**Solution**: 
- Updated admin detection to verify BOTH conditions:
  - `adminAuthenticated` flag is 'true' in localStorage
  - User email is exactly 'admin'
- Clear admin flag when regular users login/register
- Only users with email 'admin' can see admin test mode

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx` - Line 42: Added email check
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Lines 47-50: Clear admin flag for non-admin users
- `src/app/register/page.tsx` - Lines 66-67: Clear admin flag on registration

### 2. Contest Timing - Waiting Page ✅
**Problem**: Users could access contest pages before the contest started or after it ended, seeing problems and interface.

**Solution**: Created two new pages:

#### A. Contest Not Started Page
Shows when `new Date() < contest.startTime` (only for non-admin users):
- ⏰ **Live Countdown Timer**: Updates every second showing days, hours, minutes, seconds
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Blue gradient background with animated clock icon
- 📅 **Full Start Time**: Display exact start date and time
- 💡 **User Tip**: Message telling users to stay on page for auto-redirect
- 🔙 **Back Button**: Return to contests list
- ⚡ **Auto-redirect**: When timer reaches 0, page refreshes and shows contest

#### B. Contest Ended Page
Shows when `new Date() > contest.endTime` (only for non-admin users):
- 🛑 **Clear Message**: "Contest Has Ended" with red styling
- 📅 **End Time Display**: Shows when contest ended
- 🏆 **View Leaderboard Button**: Go to results
- 🔙 **Back to Contests Button**: Return to browse other contests

**Admin Bypass**: Admin users (email = 'admin') can access contests at any time for testing purposes.

## Implementation Details

### State Variables Added
```typescript
const [timeUntilStart, setTimeUntilStart] = useState<string>('');
```

### Countdown Timer Logic
- Uses `setInterval` to update every 1000ms (1 second)
- Calculates diff between current time and start time
- Formats as: "Xd Xh Xm Xs" (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- Cleans up interval on component unmount
- When countdown reaches 0, clears timer and allows access

### Conditional Rendering Flow
```
1. Is contest loaded? → No: Show loading spinner
2. Is contest loaded? → Yes: Continue
3. Is user admin? → Yes: Show full contest interface
4. Is user admin? → No: Check timing
   4a. Is contest ended? → Yes: Show "Contest Ended" page
   4b. Is contest not started? → Yes: Show "Waiting" page with countdown
   4c. Is contest active? → Yes: Show full contest interface
```

## Files Changed

### src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx
- **Line 27**: Added `timeUntilStart` state variable
- **Line 42**: Enhanced admin check: `adminAuth === 'true' && user.email === 'admin'`
- **Lines 53-91**: Added countdown timer useEffect
- **Lines 423-513**: Added contest ended page UI
- **Lines 516-584**: Added contest waiting page UI with live countdown

### src/app/login/page.tsx
- **Lines 47-50**: Clear `adminAuthenticated` flag if user email is not 'admin'

### src/app/register/page.tsx
- **Lines 66-67**: Clear `adminAuthenticated` flag on new user registration

- [ ] Access contest that hasn't started
- [ ] Verify full contest interface appears (no waiting page)
- [ ] Access contest that has ended

- [ ] Verify admin can test problems at any time

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
❌ Regular users saw admin test mode badge
❌ Users could access contests before start time
❌ Users could see problems after contest ended
❌ No indication of when contest would start
❌ Confusing for users trying to participate

### After
✅ Only actual admin sees admin test mode
✅ Users see beautiful waiting page with countdown
✅ Users see clear "Contest Ended" message with options
✅ Live countdown timer shows exactly when contest starts
✅ Clear user guidance and navigation options
✅ Admin can still test at any time

## Technical Notes

### Timer Implementation
- Uses React `useEffect` with cleanup
- `setInterval` updates countdown every second
- Prevents memory leaks with `clearInterval` on unmount
- Recalculates on contest change via dependency array `[contest]`

### Admin Detection
- Two-factor check: localStorage flag + email verification
- Prevents persistent admin mode for regular users
- Automatically cleared on login/register for non-admin users
- Secure because email comes from authenticated session

### Performance
- Countdown timer is efficient (1 operation per second)
- Early returns prevent unnecessary renders
- Conditional pages load only when needed
- No API polling - single contest fetch

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add sound notification when contest starts
- [ ] Add browser notification permission for contest start
- [ ] Show upcoming contests on waiting page
- [ ] Add progress bar for time remaining
- [ ] Add timezone display for international users
