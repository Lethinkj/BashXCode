# Feature Updates Summary

## Changes Implemented

All requested features have been successfully implemented! Here's what changed:

---

## 1. ✅ Increased Problem Limit to 10

**Before**: No clear limit
**After**: Maximum 10 problems per contest

### Changes:
- **Admin Page** (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`):
  - Added validation to prevent adding more than 10 problems
  - Shows counter: "X/10 problems added"
  - "Add Problem" button becomes disabled and grayed out at 10 problems
  - Shows "(Max reached)" when limit is hit
  - Alert message: "Maximum 10 problems allowed per contest"

---

## 2. ✅ Fixed Output Display

**Before**: Output only showed for correct submissions
**After**: Output shows for both success and error cases

### Changes:
- **Contest Page** (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Enhanced `handleRunCode()` function
  - Shows "✓ Success:" for correct output with green checkmark
  - Shows "✗ Error:" for errors with red X
  - Always displays execution time in milliseconds
  - Handles network errors separately
  - Shows "Running code..." while processing

**Example Output:**
```
✓ Success:
8

Execution Time: 23ms
```

or

```
✗ Error:
Runtime Error:
NameError: name 'x' is not defined

Execution Time: 15ms
```

## 3. ✅ All-or-Nothing Scoring

**Before**: Partial points awarded for partial test cases passed
**After**: Full points ONLY if ALL test cases pass

### Changes:
- **Submissions API** (`src/app/api/submissions/route.ts`):
  - Changed scoring logic from partial to all-or-nothing
  - `earnedPoints = allPassed ? problem.points : 0`
  - Only awards points when `result.passed === result.total`
  - Status properly set: 'accepted', 'wrong_answer', 'compilation_error', 'runtime_error'

**Example:**
- Problem worth 100 points with 5 test cases
- Pass 4/5 test cases: **0 points** ❌
- Pass 5/5 test cases: **100 points** ✅

---

## 4. ✅ Hidden Test Cases

**Before**: Showed 2 sample test cases
**After**: Shows only 1 example test case

### Changes:
- **Contest Page** (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Changed from `.slice(0, 2)` to `.slice(0, 1)`
  - Renamed "Sample Test Cases" to "Sample Test Case"
  - Changed "Test Case 1/2" to "Example"
  - Added note: "Your solution will be tested against X hidden test cases. All must pass to get full points."

**UI Display:**
```
Sample Test Case
Example
Input:
5
3

Expected Output:
8

Note: Your solution will be tested against 5 hidden test cases.
All must pass to get full points.
```

## 5. ✅ User Choice for Problem Solving

**Before**: Already worked, but now enhanced
**After**: Clear visual feedback and better UX

### Changes:
- **Contest Page** (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Problems sidebar shows all problems
  - Click any problem to switch (no restrictions)
  - Visual indicators:
    - Selected problem: Blue highlight
    - Solved problems: Green checkmark ✓
    - Shows points for each problem
  - Code editor resets when switching problems

---

## 6. ✅ Enhanced Submission Feedback

### Changes:
- **Contest Page** (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Added confirmation dialog before submission
  - Shows problem name, test case count, and points
  - Better success message with submission ID
  - Auto-refreshes submissions after 3 seconds
  - Added validation: can't submit empty code

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```
Submit your solution for "Sum Two Numbers"?

Your code will be tested against 5 test cases.
You will earn 100 points only if ALL test cases pass.

[Cancel] [OK]
```

## 7. ✅ Submission History Display

### New Feature Added:
- **Contest Page** (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Added "Your Submissions" section in problem description panel
  - Shows all submissions for current problem in reverse chronological order
  - Color-coded status badges:
    - Green: ✓ Accepted
    - Blue: ⟳ Running
    - Orange: ⚠ Compilation Error
    - Red: ✗ Wrong Answer / Runtime Error / Time Limit
  - Displays:
    - Status
    - Time of submission
    - Test cases passed (X/Y)
    - Points earned (X/Y)
    - Programming language used

**Example Display:**
```
Your Submissions

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Accepted          10:30:45 AM     │
│ Test Cases: 5/5 passed              │
│ Points: 100/100                     │
│ PYTHON                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## Summary of Logic Changes

### Scoring Logic:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Partial Points)
const pointsPerTest = problem.points / problem.testCases.length;
const earnedPoints = Math.floor(result.passed * pointsPerTest);

// AFTER (All or Nothing)
const allPassed = result.passed === result.total;
const earnedPoints = allPassed ? problem.points : 0;
```

### Test Case Display:
```typescript
// BEFORE
{selectedProblem.testCases.slice(0, 2).map(...)}

// AFTER
{selectedProblem.testCases.slice(0, 1).map(...)}
```

### Problem Limit:
```typescript
// NEW
if (problems.length >= 10) {
  alert('Maximum 10 problems allowed per contest');
  return;
}
```
