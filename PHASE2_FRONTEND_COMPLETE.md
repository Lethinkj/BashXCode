## Authentication Flow

```
New User Flow:
1. Visit homepage (/) → See landing page
2. Click "Sign Up" → Register with email/password
3. Auto-login → Redirect to /join
4. Enter contest code → Join contest
5. Click contest → Solve problems
6. Submit solutions → Climb leaderboard

Returning User Flow:
1. Visit homepage (/) → Auto-redirect to /join (if logged in)
2. Or click "Sign In" → Login with email/password
3. See joined contests → Enter active contest
4. Solve problems
```

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Email/Password Authentication
- User registration with validation
- Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
- Session management with localStorage (24-hour expiry)
- Auto-logout on session expiry

### ✅ Contest Codes
- 6-character codes generated from contest titles
- Displayed prominently in admin panel
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Join contests via code (not URL)

### ✅ Time-Based Scheduling
- Contest start/end times in datetime-local pickers
- Real-time status updates (upcoming/active/ended)
- Time remaining display for active contests
- Access control (can't submit if contest not active)

### ✅ Submit Button Logic
- Disabled by default
- Enabled only when all test cases pass
- Disabled if contest not active
- Tooltip explains why button is disabled
- Visual feedback with button text

### ✅ User Management
- Full name and email stored in database
- Leaderboard shows real names
- User profile data in navbar
- Contest participation tracking

### ✅ Admin Features
- View all contests with codes
- Copy contest codes
- Delete contests (with confirmation)
- See contest timing at a glance

## Breaking Changes
All references to `userName` (string) have been replaced with `userId` (UUID):
- Contest page state variables
- API calls and query parameters
- Submission objects
- Leaderboard keys

Users must now register/login instead of entering a name.
