# ‚úÖ SERVER FIXED AND RUNNING!

## Problem Solved

### Issue:
```
Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'D:\clan\.next\trace'
```

### Root Cause:
- Multiple Node.js processes were running
- .next folder was locked by these processes
- Could not delete or recreate cache files

### Solution:
1. ‚úÖ Killed all Node.js processes using `taskkill`
2. ‚úÖ Removed .next folder using `rmdir`
3. ‚úÖ Started fresh development server

## Quick Test

### Step 1: Open Homepage
```
http://localhost:3000
```
‚úÖ Should say "Welcome to Bash X Code Contests"

Create a test account or login

### Step 3: Join Contest
Use a contest code to join

### Step 4: Test Full-Screen
- Should auto-enter full-screen
- Try pressing Esc
- Try clicking code editor
- Should force full-screen

## If Server Stops Again

### Quick Fix Script:
Run the batch file we created:
```
.\start-dev-server.bat
```

Or manually:
```powershell
# Kill all node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Wait 2 seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2

# Remove .next folder
rmdir /s /q .next

# Start server
npm run dev
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Application ‚úÖ
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Verify branding changes
- Test full-screen feature
- Check all pages

### 2. Apply Database Migration ‚è≥
**File:** `add-coding-time-tracking.sql`

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy content from file
4. Click Run
5. Verify tables created

**Enables:**
- Solve time tracking
- Time-based leaderboard ranking
- Competition speed metrics

### 3. Production Deployment üöÄ
When ready:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you see EPERM error again:
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
rmdir /s /q .next
npm run dev
```

### If port 3000 is in use:
Server will automatically use port 3001 or 3002

### If you see "Aura-7F":
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify you're on localhost:3000
