# ‚ö†Ô∏è CLOSE THESE TABS IN VS CODE

## The Problem
You're seeing errors for these files:
- `src/app/api/log-screenshot/route.ts` 
- `src/app/api/screenshots/route.ts`

These files are **DELETED from your hard drive** ‚úÖ but VS Code still has them **open in tabs** ‚ùå

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION (10 seconds)

### Look at the top of VS Code (where your file tabs are):

1. Find the tab: **`route.ts src\app\api\log-screenshot`**
   - Click the **X** to close it

2. Find the tab: **`route.ts src\app\api\screenshots`**  
   - Click the **X** to close it

3. Press **`Ctrl+Shift+P`**
   - Type: **`reload window`**
   - Press **Enter**

### ‚úÖ DONE! All errors gone!

---

## Alternative: Close ALL Tabs

If you have many tabs open:

1. Right-click on any tab
2. Select **"Close All"**
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí `reload window`

---

## Why This Happens

When VS Code has a file open and you delete it from disk, the tab remains open with the old content. VS Code thinks the file still exists.

**Solution**: Close the tab so VS Code knows it's gone!

---

## Verify Files Are Deleted ‚úÖ

```powershell
‚úì log-screenshot DELETED
‚úì screenshots DELETED
```

The files don't exist anymore - just close the tabs! üéâ
