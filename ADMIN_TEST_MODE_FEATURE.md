# ✅ Admin Test Mode - Feature Complete

## Overview

Admins can now test contests without affecting the leaderboard or point calculations!

---

## Features

### ✅ What Admins CAN Do:
- Join any contest
- Write and submit code
- See test results and notifications
- View their submission history
- Test all contest features

### ❌ What Admins CANNOT Do:
- Appear in public leaderboard
- Affect student rankings
- Influence point calculations
- Be counted in participant statistics

---

## Visual Indicator

When an admin enters a contest, they see a purple banner at the top:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧪 ADMIN TEST MODE - Your submissions won't     │
│    appear in leaderboard or affect scoring  🧪  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Admin Detection

**Admin users** are stored in `admin_users` table and have special localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('adminUser') // exists for admins
localStorage.getItem('authUser')   // exists for regular users
```

### 2. Leaderboard Filtering

The leaderboard SQL query **excludes** anyone whose email exists in `admin_users`:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM contest_participants cp
JOIN users u ON cp.user_id = u.id
WHERE cp.contest_id = ${contestId}
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = u.email
  )
ORDER BY ...
```

### 3. Contest Page Detection

When contest page loads, it checks if the logged-in user is an admin:

```typescript
setIsAdminTestMode(isAdminUser());
```

If true, the purple banner appears.

## Testing Steps

### As Admin:

1. **Login as admin**: `/admin`
   - Email: `kjlethin24@gmail.com`
   - Password: `909254`

2. **Navigate to contests**: Click "Join Contest" or go to `/join`

3. **Join a contest**

4. **Verify banner**: Purple "ADMIN TEST MODE" banner should appear

5. **Write and submit code**:
   - Submit solutions (partial or full)
   - Get notifications normally
   - See submission history

6. **Check leaderboard**: `/contest/{id}/leaderboard`
   - Your email should **NOT** appear
   - Only regular users are listed
   - Rankings unaffected by your submissions

### As Regular User:

1. **Login normally**: `/login`

2. **Join same contest**

3. **Submit solutions**

4. **Check leaderboard**:
   - You **SHOULD** appear
   - Admin is not listed
   - Your rank is accurate

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/auth.ts`
Added helper functions:
```typescript
export function isAdminUser(): boolean
export function getAdminUser(): any | null
```

### 2. `src/lib/storage.ts`
Updated leaderboard query to exclude admins:
```typescript
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = u.email
)
```

### 3. `src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`
- Import `isAdminUser`
- Add `isAdminTestMode` state
- Detect admin on load
- Render purple banner

---

## Database Schema

**No changes needed!** Uses existing tables:

- `admin_users` - Already exists for admin authentication
- `users` - Regular users
- `contest_participants` - Tracks all participants (including admins)
- Leaderboard query filters using email comparison

---

## Benefits

### For Admins:
✅ Test problems before students see them  
✅ Verify execution and test cases work  
✅ Check difficulty levels  
✅ Debug issues safely  
✅ Preview student experience  

### For Students:
✅ Fair leaderboard (no admin interference)  
✅ Accurate rankings  
✅ Trustworthy point calculations  
✅ Better contest integrity

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Admin joins as regular user**:
   - If admin logs out and logs in as regular user → appears in leaderboard
   - Email check ensures proper filtering

2. **Admin switches mid-contest**:
   - Banner updates on page refresh
   - Previous submissions remain (but hidden from leaderboard)

3. **Multiple admins**:
   - ALL admins excluded (query uses `EXISTS` check)
   - Each admin sees their own submissions

4. **Admin creates contest**:
   - Can test their own contests
   - Doesn't affect participant count

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Admin Analytics Panel**:
   - See all admin test submissions
