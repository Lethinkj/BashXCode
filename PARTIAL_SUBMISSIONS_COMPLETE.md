# ✅ Partial Submissions & Submission History - COMPLETE

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive partial credit system that allows users to submit solutions when they pass ≥2 test cases (with 50% points), view all their submission history with code, and upgrade to full credit by resubmitting improved solutions.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Partial Credit System**
- ✅ **Minimum Requirement**: Pass at least 2 test cases to submit successfully
- ✅ **Point Calculation**:
  - All tests passed → 100% points (full credit)
  - ≥2 tests passed → 50% points (partial credit)
  - <2 tests passed → 0 points (failure)
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: New `'partial'` status in addition to accepted/wrong_answer/error

### 2. **Point Upgrade System**
- ✅ Users can resubmit improved solutions
- ✅ If previously had partial credit (50%), new full solution earns full points (100%)
- ✅ Leaderboard automatically reflects best submission points
- ✅ All submissions are preserved for history

### 3. **Submission History Viewer**
- ✅ **View All Submissions**: List of all attempts with status, test results, points
- ✅ **Code Viewer Modal**: Click "View Code" to see full submitted code
- ✅ **Syntax Highlighting**: Code displayed in dark theme with proper formatting
- ✅ **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copy of submitted code
- ✅ **Load into Editor**: Restore previous submission to continue editing

### 4. **Enhanced UI Notifications**
- ✅ **Partial Credit Alert**: "Your solution passed X/Y test cases and earned Z points (50%)"
- ✅ **Improvement Hints**: "Fix remaining cases to get full points!"
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for partial vs full solutions
- ✅ **Clear Status Badges**: ✓ Accepted, ◐ Partial (50%), ✗ Failed

## 📊 How It Works

### Submission Flow

```
User submits code
       ↓
Run all test cases
       ↓
Count passed tests
       ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ All tests passed?   │
│ Yes → 100% points   │ ✓ Accepted
│ No → Check partial  │
└─────────────────────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ ≥2 tests passed?    │
│ Yes → 50% points    │ ◐ Partial
│ No → 0 points       │ ✗ Failed
└─────────────────────┘
       ↓
Save to database
Show notification
Update leaderboard
```

### Point Upgrade Example

```
Submission 1: 2/5 tests → Partial (50 points)
   User sees: "⚠️ Partial Credit! Fix remaining cases for full 100 points"
   
Submission 2: 3/5 tests → Partial (50 points)
   User sees: "⚠️ Partial Credit! Getting closer..."
   
Submission 3: 5/5 tests → Accepted (100 points)
   User sees: "✅ All Tests Passed! You earned 100 points! 🎊"
   
Final Score: 100 points (best submission)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **Type System Updates** (`src/types/index.ts`)

```typescript
export interface Submission {
  // ... existing fields
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'accepted' | 'partial' | 'wrong_answer' | 'time_limit' | 'runtime_error' | 'compile_error' | 'compilation_error' | 'error';
  // 'partial' added to status union type
}
```

### 2. **API Updates** (`src/app/api/submissions/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Award points ONLY if ALL test cases pass
const allPassed = result.passed === result.total;
const earnedPoints = allPassed ? problem.points : 0;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Award points based on test cases passed
const allPassed = result.passed === result.total;
const partialPassed = result.passed >= 2 && result.passed < result.total;

let earnedPoints = 0;
if (allPassed) {
  earnedPoints = problem.points; // 100%
} else if (partialPassed) {
  earnedPoints = Math.floor(problem.points * 0.5); // 50%
}

// Set appropriate status
let status = 'wrong_answer';
if (allPassed) status = 'accepted';
else if (partialPassed) status = 'partial';
```

### 3. **Frontend Updates** (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`)

#### Added State:
```typescript
const [showSubmissionsModal, setShowSubmissionsModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedSubmission, setSelectedSubmission] = useState<Submission | null>(null);
```

#### Updated Notifications:
```typescript
if (latestSub.status === 'partial') {
  setNotification({
    type: 'warning',
    title: '⚠️ Partial Credit!',
    message: `Passed ${passedCount}/${totalCount} test cases, earned ${partialPoints} points (50%). Fix remaining cases for full ${problemPoints} points!`
  });
}
```

#### Submission Display:
```typescript
<span className={`badge ${
  sub.status === 'accepted' ? 'bg-green' :
  sub.status === 'partial' ? 'bg-yellow' :
  'bg-red'
}`}>
  {sub.status === 'accepted' ? '✓ Accepted' :
   sub.status === 'partial' ? '◐ Partial (50%)' :
   '✗ Failed'}
</span>
```

#### View Code Button:
```typescript
<button onClick={() => {
  setSelectedSubmission(sub);
  setShowSubmissionsModal(true);
}}>
  View Code →
</button>
```

### 4. **Submission Modal Component**

Full-featured modal with:
- **Header**: Submission timestamp and close button
- **Stats Grid**: Status, test cases, points, language
- **Improvement Banner**: For partial submissions
- **Code Display**: Dark theme with syntax highlighting
- **Actions**: Copy to clipboard, load into editor, close

## 💾 Database Storage

### Submissions Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  contest_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  problem_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  code TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Full submitted code stored here
  language TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,             -- Can be 'partial'
  passed_test_cases INTEGER,
  total_test_cases INTEGER,
  points INTEGER,                   -- 0, 50%, or 100% of problem points
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP,
  execution_time DECIMAL,
  details TEXT,                     -- JSON with test case results
  solve_time_seconds INTEGER
);
```

### Query Examples

**Find all partial submissions:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, problem_id, passed_test_cases, total_test_cases, points
FROM submissions
WHERE status = 'partial'
ORDER BY submitted_at DESC;
```

**User's progression on a problem:**
```sql
SELECT submitted_at, status, passed_test_cases, points
FROM submissions
WHERE user_id = 'user-123' AND problem_id = 'problem-456'
ORDER BY submitted_at ASC;
-- Shows: partial (50) → partial (50) → accepted (100)
```

**Best submission per user per problem:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (user_id, problem_id)
  user_id, problem_id, status, points, submitted_at
FROM submissions
ORDER BY user_id, problem_id, points DESC, submitted_at DESC;
```

## 🔐 Security & Edge Cases

### Handled Edge Cases:

1. **Multiple Partial Submissions**:
   - Each gets 50% points
   - Leaderboard shows best (not sum)
   - All stored in history

2. **Partial → Full Upgrade**:
   - New submission earns full 100%
   - Previous partial (50%) stays in history
   - Leaderboard updates automatically

3. **Full → Partial Downgrade**:
   - User already has full credit
   - New partial submission is saved
   - Leaderboard keeps higher score (100%)

4. **Code Storage**:
   - Full code stored in `submissions.code` field
   - No truncation or compression
   - Retrieved on demand for viewing

5. **Concurrent Submissions**:
   - Each has unique ID
   - Race conditions handled by DB constraints
   - Latest points calculation uses all submissions
