## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration

You need to update your Supabase database to add the `user_name` column.

#### Option A: Fresh Installation (No existing table)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy the contents of: tab-switches-migration.sql
-- This creates the table with all columns including user_name
```

#### Option B: Update Existing Table

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy the contents of: add-username-to-tab-switches.sql
-- This adds user_name column to your existing table
```

### Step 2: Test the Features

#### Test Copy-Paste Prevention

1. Join a contest
2. Open the code editor
3. Try to copy code (Ctrl+C) - Should be blocked ‚ùå
4. Try to paste code (Ctrl+V) - Should be blocked ‚ùå
5. Try right-click menu - Should be disabled ‚ùå
6. Type code normally - Should work ‚úÖ

#### Test Tab Switch Warning

1. Join a contest as a participant
2. Switch to another browser tab
3. Switch back - You should see a red warning with YOUR NAME
4. Warning should show: "[Your Name] - Switching tabs is being monitored"
5. Switch count should increment

#### Test Admin View

1. Login as admin (`/admin`)
2. Click "üìä Admin Leaderboard" for a contest
3. Look for "‚ö†Ô∏è Tab Switch Alerts" section
4. You should see **usernames** (not just emails) of people who switched tabs

#### Test Presentation Mode

1. In admin leaderboard, click "üìä Presentation Mode"
2. Browser enters fullscreen
3. Look for red banner at the top
4. Banner should show:
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è TAB SWITCH ALERTS"
   - Top 3 offenders with their **names**
   - Switch counts for each
5. Click "Exit Presentation" to leave

- See how many times they switched
- See timestamp of last switch

Presentation mode (fullscreen):

## Common Issues

### "Username shows as email"

**Fix**: Run the database migration script `add-username-to-tab-switches.sql`

**Fix**: 
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors

### "Presentation banner not showing"
