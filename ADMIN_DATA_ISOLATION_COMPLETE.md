# ✅ Admin Data Isolation - Complete

## 🎯 Overview

Admin test data is now **completely isolated** from regular user data. Admins can test freely without:
- ❌ Appearing in leaderboards
- ❌ Tab switches being tracked
- ❌ Fullscreen exits being logged
- ❌ Test data polluting admin monitoring views

---

## 🔒 Data Isolation Features

### 1. **Tab Switch Tracking** - Admins Excluded ✅

**What Changed:**
- Tab switch detection **disabled** for admins in test mode
- No tab switch warnings shown to admins
- No tab switch logs created for admin actions
- Admin dashboard tab switch view **excludes** admin test data

**Technical:**
```typescript
// Skip tab switch detection for admins
if (isAdminTestMode) return;

// SQL query excludes admin emails
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = ts.user_email
)
```

### 2. **Fullscreen Exit Tracking** - Admins Excluded ✅

**What Changed:**
- Fullscreen exit detection **disabled** for admins
- No fullscreen warnings shown to admins
- No fullscreen exit logs for admin testing
- Admins can freely exit/enter fullscreen

**Technical:**
```typescript
// Skip fullscreen detection for admins
if (isAdminTestMode) return;
```

### 3. **Leaderboard** - Admins Never Listed ✅

**What Changed:**
- Admin emails **never appear** in public leaderboard
- Admin emails **never appear** in admin leaderboard monitoring
- Only regular users are ranked and displayed

**Technical:**
```sql
-- Leaderboard query filters out admins
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = u.email
)
```

### 4. **Submissions** - Stored but Invisible ✅

**What Changed:**
- Admin submissions are saved (for admin's own review)
- Admin submissions **don't count** toward leaderboard
- Admin points **don't affect** rankings
- Admin can view their own test submission history

---

## 📊 Complete Data Separation

### Admin Data Flow:
```
Admin Tests Contest
        ↓
Submissions Saved → Can view own submissions
        ↓
NOT in Leaderboard ❌
NOT in Tab Switch logs ❌
NOT tracked for violations ❌
```

### Student Data Flow:
```
Student Takes Contest
        ↓
Submissions Saved → Appears in leaderboard ✅
        ↓
Tab switches tracked ✅
Fullscreen exits logged ✅
Violations monitored ✅
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Tab Switch Detection (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Tab switch detection (skip for admins in test mode)
useEffect(() => {
  // Don't track tab switches for admins in test mode
  if (isAdminTestMode) return;
  
  const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (document.hidden) {
      // Track tab switch only for regular users
      // ...
    }
  };
  // ...
}, [contestId, userId, userEmail, isAdminTestMode]);
```

#### 2. Fullscreen Exit Detection (`src/app/contest/[id]/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Fullscreen exit detection (skip for admins in test mode)
useEffect(() => {
  // Don't track fullscreen exits for admins in test mode
  if (isAdminTestMode) return;
  
  const handleFullscreenChange = () => {
    // Track only for regular users
    // ...
  };
  // ...
}, [contest, contestId, userId, userEmail, userName, isAdminTestMode]);
```

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Tab Switches API (`src/app/api/tab-switches/route.ts`)
```sql
-- Exclude admin tab switches
SELECT 
  ts.user_id,
  ts.user_email,
  ts.switch_count,
  ts.last_switch_time
FROM tab_switches ts
WHERE ts.contest_id = ${contestId}
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = ts.user_email
  )
ORDER BY ts.switch_count DESC
```

#### 2. Leaderboard API (`src/lib/storage.ts`)
```sql
-- Exclude admins from leaderboard
SELECT 
  cp.user_id,
  u.email,
  u.full_name,
  ps.total_points,
  ps.solved_problems
FROM contest_participants cp
JOIN users u ON cp.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN participant_scores ps ON cp.user_id = ps.user_id
WHERE cp.contest_id = ${contestId}
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = u.email
  )
ORDER BY total_points DESC
```

## 📊 Database Queries

### What Gets Filtered:

| Query | Includes Admin? | Includes Students? |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Public Leaderboard | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Admin Leaderboard | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Tab Switch Logs | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Submissions (Own View) | ✅ YES (own only) | ✅ YES (own only) |
| Contest Participants | ✅ YES (for join) | ✅ YES |

### Filter Mechanism:

All filtering uses the same pattern:
```sql
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM admin_users au WHERE au.email = user.email
)
```

This ensures:

- ✅ No admin data leakage
- ✅ Simple to maintain
- ✅ Performant with proper indexes

## 📞 Support

### Common Questions:

**Q: "Why can't I see admin test data in admin dashboard?"**
- **A**: Admin test data is intentionally hidden to keep monitoring views clean. Only student data is shown.

**Q: "Can admin view their own test submissions?"**
- **A**: Yes! Admins can see their own submissions in the contest page, just not in the leaderboard or admin monitoring views.

**Q: "What if I want to compete as admin?"**
- **A**: Logout from admin panel, create/use a regular user account, and join the contest normally.

**Q: "Are admin test sessions saved?"**
- **A**: Yes, submissions are saved for admin's review, but they're filtered out from all public and monitoring views.
