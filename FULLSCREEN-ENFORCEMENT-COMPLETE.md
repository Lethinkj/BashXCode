# 🔒 FULL-SCREEN CODE ENFORCEMENT - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed "Aura-7f" from Header
**Before:**
```
[Logo] Bash X Code  Aura-7f Contest Platform
```

**After:**
```
[Logo] Bash X Code
```

**What Changed:**
- Removed contest title from header
- Shows only clean "Bash X Code" logo
- Consistent across all pages

---

### 2. ✅ Force Full-Screen on Code Editor Click
**Problem:** Users could exit full-screen and continue coding

**Solution:** Implemented multi-layer full-screen enforcement

---

## Full-Screen Enforcement System

### Layer 1: Auto Entry on Contest Start
```
User joins active contest → Automatically enters full-screen
```

### Layer 2: Editor Click Enforcement
```
User clicks code editor → Checks if in full-screen
                        ↓
                  Not in full-screen?
                        ↓
              Request full-screen immediately
                        ↓
              Show warning notification
```

### Layer 3: Editor Focus Enforcement
```
User tries to type in editor → Checks if in full-screen
                              ↓
                        Not in full-screen?
                              ↓
                    Request full-screen immediately
```

### Layer 4: Read-Only Mode
```
Not in full-screen → Editor becomes READ-ONLY
                  ↓
          User cannot type code
                  ↓
       Must enter full-screen to code
```

### Layer 5: Exit Detection
```
User exits full-screen (press Esc) → Logged as tab switch violation
                                   ↓
                         Show warning notification
                                   ↓
                         Tab switch counter increases
                                   ↓
                         Admin can see in leaderboard
```

## Technical Implementation

### Code Editor Configuration

**Read-Only When Not in Full-Screen:**
```typescript
options={{
  readOnly: !document.fullscreenElement, // Editor locked if not full-screen
  // ... other options
}}
```

**Click Handler:**
```typescript
<div onClick={async () => {
  if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
    await document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
    // Show warning notification
  }
}}>
  <Editor ... />
</div>
```

**Focus Handler:**
```typescript
editor.onDidFocusEditorText(() => {
  if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
    document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
  }
});
```

**Dynamic Read-Only Updates:**
```typescript
const updateReadOnly = () => {
  editor.updateOptions({ readOnly: !document.fullscreenElement });
};
document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', updateReadOnly);
```
