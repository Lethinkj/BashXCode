# ✅ Template Generation Fix - COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
You were seeing basic templates (single input) even when test cases had 2 numbers like `5 3`.

### Root Cause
The `getLanguageTemplate` function wasn't calling `generateTemplate()` - it was just returning basic fallback templates.

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Updated `getLanguageTemplate` to use `generateTemplate(lang, problem.testCases)`
2. ✅ Made it a `useCallback` with proper dependencies
3. ✅ Updated `useEffect` to pass `selectedProblem` parameter
4. ✅ Updated problem click handler to pass problem when switching

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST NOW

### Step 1: Create a Problem with 2 Numbers

In Admin Panel, when creating a test case:

**Input field:** 
```
5 3
```
(That's the number 5, a space, then the number 3)

**Expected Output field:**
```
8
```

### Step 2: Go to Contest Page

When you select that problem, you should now see:

**Python:**
```python
# Auto-generated template based on test case input format
# You can modify this code as needed

# Read two space-separated integers
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Your solution here
result = a + b  # Replace with your logic
print(result)
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Auto-generated template based on test case input format
// You can modify this code as needed

const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.on('line', (line) => {
  // Read two space-separated integers
  const [a, b] = line.split(' ').map(Number);

  // Your solution here
  const result = a + b; // Replace with your logic
  console.log(result);
  rl.close();
});
```

## ✅ What You Should See

1. **Smart Comments**: "Read two space-separated integers" (not just "Read a single integer")
2. **Correct Parsing**: `a, b = map(int, input().split())` (not just `n = int(input())`)
3. **Input Format Box** (blue box above test cases):
   - 📥 Input Format: Two space-separated integers on one line (e.g., "5 3")
   - 💡 Tip: Your starter code template is already configured to read this format correctly!

## 🎯 Test Different Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Number
**Input:** `5`  
**Template:** `n = int(input())`

### Pattern 2: Two Numbers (Space-Separated)
**Input:** `5 3`  
**Template:** `a, b = map(int, input().split())`

### Pattern 3: Multiple Numbers
**Input:** `1 2 3 4 5`  
**Template:** `numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))`

### Pattern 4: Two Lines (Number then Array)
**Input:** 
```
3
5 10 15
```
**Template:** 
```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

1. **Hard Refresh**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` to clear cache
2. **Check Dev Server**: Should show "✓ Ready" with no errors
3. **Check Test Case Format**: 
   - Use `5 3` (with ONE space)
   - NOT `5  3` (two spaces)
   - NOT `"5 3"` (with quotes)
4. **Check Browser Console**: Press F12, look for errors

## 📊 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Broken) ❌
```python
# Write your solution here
def solve():
    n = int(input())  # Only reads ONE number!
    print(n)

solve()
```
**Problem**: Test has `5 3`, but code only reads first number!

### AFTER (Fixed) ✅
```python
# Auto-generated template based on test case input format
# You can modify this code as needed

# Read two space-separated integers
a, b = map(int, input().split())  # Reads BOTH numbers!

# Your solution here
result = a + b  # Replace with your logic
print(result)
```
**Solution**: Automatically detects `5 3` pattern and generates correct code!

---

## ✅ All Fixed Now!

The template generation system is now working correctly. When you create a problem with input `5 3`, it will automatically generate code that reads two space-separated integers.

Your dev server is running at: **http://localhost:3000**

Go test it! 🚀
