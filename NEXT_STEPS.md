## ⏳ What You Must Do NOW

### 1️⃣ **Run Database Migration** (REQUIRED!)

The code expects a `user_name` column in the `tab_switches` table.

#### If You Have NO `tab_switches` Table Yet:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `tab-switches-migration.sql`
3. Paste and run it
4. ✅ Table created with all columns

#### If You ALREADY Have a `tab_switches` Table:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `add-username-to-tab-switches.sql`
3. Paste and run it
4. ✅ Column added to existing table

**Why this is critical**:
- Without this migration, tab switch logging will fail
- API expects `user_name` column to exist
- App will show errors if column is missing

### 2️⃣ **Wait for Vercel Deployment**

Your changes are automatically deploying to Vercel:

1. Check Vercel dashboard for build status
2. Wait for "Deployment Ready" message
3. Visit your live site URL
4. Verify features are working

**Expected Timeline**: 2-5 minutes from push

---

### 3️⃣ **Test All Features**

Once deployed, test everything:

#### Test Copy-Paste Prevention
```
1. Go to live site
2. Login as a participant
3. Join a contest
4. Try to copy code (Ctrl+C) → Should be blocked ❌
5. Try to paste code (Ctrl+V) → Should be blocked ❌
6. Verify typing still works ✅
```

#### Test Username in Warnings
```
1. Join a contest
2. Switch to another tab
3. Come back
4. You should see: "[Your Name] - Switching tabs is being monitored"
5. Not just "Tab Switch Detected!" ✅
```

#### Test Admin View
```
1. Login as admin
2. Go to contest leaderboard
3. Look for "⚠️ Tab Switch Alerts" section
4. Should show NAMES, not just emails ✅
```

#### Test Presentation Mode
```
1. In admin leaderboard
2. Click "📊 Presentation Mode"
3. Browser goes fullscreen
4. Red banner at top shows:
   - "⚠️ TAB SWITCH ALERTS"
   - Names of top 3 offenders
   - Switch counts
5. Click "Exit Presentation" ✅
```

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Copy-Paste Still Works

**Try**:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Username Shows as Email

**Fix**: You didn't run the database migration!
1. Run `add-username-to-tab-switches.sql` in Supabase
2. Refresh the page
3. Switch tabs again
4. Should now show name

### Presentation Banner Not Visible

**Check**:
1. Did you click "📊 Presentation Mode"?
2. Did you enter fullscreen?
3. Have any users actually switched tabs?
4. Look at TOP-LEFT corner of screen (not bottom)

### API Errors in Console

**Most Common**:
- Missing `user_name` column → Run migration
- Network error → Check Supabase connection
- Auth error → Re-login
